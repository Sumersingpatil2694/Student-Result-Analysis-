# Student Result Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing student results using a dataset, `df`. We utilize the Seaborn library to visualize categorical data distributions (like the distribution of students across different ethnic groups) using a count plot. This notebook demonstrates how to create these visualizations and interpret the results.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `pandas`: To manipulate and work with the dataset.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `matplotlib`: To handle the display of plots.

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure you load the dataset `df` into the notebook. The dataset should contain relevant columns, including `EthnicGroup`.

2. **Import Libraries**: The notebook starts by importing Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization.

   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

3. **Plotting Data**: The primary plot generated in this notebook is a count plot for visualizing the distribution of students across different ethnic groups.

   ```python
   ax = sns.countplot(data=df, x='EthnicGroup')
   ax.bar_label(ax.containers[])  # Adds labels to the bars
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Bar Labels**: The function `bar_label` is used to add numeric labels to each bar, providing insight into the count of students per ethnic group directly on the plot.

## Output

The notebook will generate a bar plot showing the count of students in different ethnic groups, with labels on each bar displaying the exact count. This is useful for visually analyzing the distribution of students across different groups.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates basic data visualization techniques using Seaborn, helping to gain insights into categorical distributions within the dataset.
